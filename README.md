# Password Breaker with Recursion

Description
The Password Breaker with Recursion is a Python script that can be used to crack passwords using a recursive algorithm. The script works by trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This can be a time-consuming process, but with enough computing power, it is possible to break even complex passwords.

Usage
To use the Password Breaker with Recursion script, simply run the script from the command line and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter the password you wish to crack, and the script will begin trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

By default, the script uses a set of common characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) to generate possible passwords. You can customize the character set by modifying the CHARSET variable in the script.

Limitations
While the Password Breaker with Recursion script can be effective at cracking passwords, there are some limitations to be aware of:

The script can be time-consuming to run, especially for longer passwords or more complex character sets.
The script may not work on passwords that have been hashed or encrypted using strong encryption methods.
The script may not work on passwords that have been salted (i.e., had a random string of characters added to them to make them more secure).

Security Considerations
It is important to note that using this script to crack passwords without permission is illegal and unethical. You should only use this script for ethical purposes, such as testing the security of your own passwords or systems with the permission of the owner.

In addition, you should always use strong, unique passwords and follow other security best practices to protect your personal information and digital assets.
